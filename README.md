# ImagiGen - AI-Driven Image Generation with GANs

ImagiGen is a cutting-edge project designed to create images inspired by the CIFAR-10 dataset through the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system consists of two key components: the Generator, which crafts images, and the Discriminator, which distinguishes between authentic and generated visuals.

## Core Features
- Implements a custom GAN to learn from the CIFAR-10 image set.
- Produces visuals that are similar to CIFAR-10 but with diverse variations.
- Compatible with both Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab for seamless model training and image generation.

## Applications
- **Dataset Expansion**: Generate synthetic images to enlarge existing datasets.
- **Creative Exploration**: Experiment with new artistic concepts using generated images.
- **Prototyping**: Use AI-generated visuals for mock-ups or interface design.

## Instructions
### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.

### Model Training
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository or upload it to Google Colab for cloud-based training.
2. Run the notebook to train the GAN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
3. Take advantage of GPU support for faster model training, especially if using Google Colab.

### Image Creation
- Once the model is trained, utilize it to generate new images.
- Adjust the values in the latent space to explore variations in the generated images.

## Important Information
- This project does not come with a graphical interface. It is designed to be used in Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab.
- For optimal performance, use GPU acceleration when training the model.
- Contributions are highly encouraged! Feel free to fork the repository, add your improvements, and submit a pull request.
